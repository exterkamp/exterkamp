I'm an engineer at Google.

I work on the [Fi frontend](https://fi.google.com/) nowadays.

I used to hack on web performance a lot with projects like:
* [Lighthouse](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse)
* [Pagespeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/)
* [Chrome UX Report](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-user-experience-report)

These days I write mostly Type/Javascript, golang, Java, with some Python & C++ in the past.
