I'm an engineer at Google hacking on Web Performance.

You can usually find me working on...
* [Lighthouse](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse)
* [Pagespeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/)
* [Chrome UX Report](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-user-experience-report)

These days I write mostly Go, Javascript, and C++; with many Python one-liners & a bit of Java in the past. I spend my free time playing Kane & Lynch 2.
